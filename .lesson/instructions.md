# Instructions  

 Multiple Classes Independent Practice
The pet shelter needs your help creating an online gallery wall for their pets! They only have THREE rules:

The images need to be aligned horizontally on the page.

They need to ALL be styled uniquely using class attributes.

You MUST work together with a partner!

Choose your roles!
Decide who will be the navigator and who will be the driver.
Round 1! 6 minutes
By the end of this round...

Your images need to be nested in a parent <div>, and...

Flexbox needs to be applied so that the images are aligned horizontally on the page.

Your gallery wall should have an awesome background-color.

Round 2! 6 minutes
Now, switch roles. By the end of this round...

Your images need to be adjusted to a smaller size, using the existing CSS and class names.

Your images should have unique borders, using the existing CSS and class names.

One image should be round.

If there is time, switch roles again!
Add any extra CSS styling and classes that will make this gallery wall POP! Here are some examples:

Can you create a gallery wall with TWO rows of images?

Can you add some other border stylings and apply them to the images?
